    Arthur: Iora said that it''s not dangerous, just phantom
    pain from the accident despite of the prosthetic.

    Aubree: Despite of the
    prosthetic? I thought that it was supposed to suppress such things.

    Arthur:
    So she said. She told me that she will ask Moana if there are funds for calling
    a technician to see it.

    Aubree: Can''t Erlene check it out? She''s the mechanic
    and maintenance person here.

    Arthur: Iora was against it since she hasn''t
    worked with prosthetics on the level my issue requires.

    Arthur: Although
    I''m pretty sure people in general don''t like Erlene that much here, so it might
    have factored in to that.

    Aubree: Yes... She does seem... off somehow. And
    as far as I''ve deduced from his actions, Lysander appears to be afraid of being
    left alone with her.

    Arthur: For someone as shy as him, being left alone
    with anyone is probably a nightmare. Poor guy

    Aubree: I think there''s something
    else behind it than just that.

    Arthur: Well, I suppose it''s none of our
    business. If Erlene is causing trouble but is still here, it must mean that she''s
    not too bad to justice the effort of rehiring.

    Aubree: I guess you''re right,
    darling.'

    Award:
    Ask ahead.

    White: Can''t you do anything about Erlene''s case?

    Award:
    Not unless Lysander makes an official complaint. Haven''t been able to convince
    him to do so yet.

    White: Ah, I see.

    Award: If you do witness her doing
    that garbage, feel free to file a complaint yourself so that I can stop acting
    like an undercover agent.

    White: I don''t think she does that when there
    are others around, so that''ll probably be toubh.

    White: *tough

    White:
    I''ll see if I can spot any CCTV footage for a complaint.

    Award: I''d appreciate
    that. Thank you.

    White: No problem. Happy to help such an accepting team
    :)

    Award: And we are more than happy to have you! :)

    Dear Diary,



    Merry Christmas.
    I''m stuck up here because of work this Christmas too. Not that I''d have family
    down on Earth anymore, at least any that''d care to have me down there. The Moon
    Station crew isn''t my family, but it''s stable enough to be the closest thing
    I have to it.



    I just wish Meredith saw reason. Last I heard, she was still
    hung up on our parents'' deaths during The Pandemic. It''s been four years and
    she still hasn''t gotten therapy, apparently. The grapevine told me that the
    government was willing to pay for it just to get her back to the work force (God
    knows we need everyone who can work right now), but she declined. Idiot little
    sister. If only she''d stop being such a spoiled, entitled brat and took some
    responsibility. We have more than too many freeloaders as it is even though we
    can barely support the disabled and sick who can''t work.



    Well, hopefully
    we''ll have some answers to the lack of work force soon since this year has been
    getting better and better with the project. Science keeps surprising me even
    though I''ve been in the field for over two decades.'

    but by his own choice.



    I was not able to get many details before he stormed
    off to the supply shuttle, but apparently he found one of Erlene''s writings
    featuring him in a very questionable situation. Unfortunately, we cannot find
    any proof as he tore the papers (yes, it was written on paper according to him,
    on multiple pages) and destroyed at least most of the pieces.



    Moana is
    already in the process of finding someone else to fill in the cleaning position.
    In the meantime, I will handle most of the necessary janitorial duties.

  m_Description: '30th June, 2024



    This is Moana Vidiri writing. I am sad to
    announce that the leader of the Project Moonshot team, Gideon Olmo, has passed
    away alongside his wife, Samantha Olmo.



    Two days ago, Gideon wrote that
    we had succeeded in making sentient life. It seemed a little aggressive, but
    Samantha was certain that it would calm down once it would get out of its breeding
    tube.



    Unfortunately, she was wrong. Subject Alpha assaulted the staff
    and badly injured both Olmos before Oscar was able to subdue it. Samantha was
    already dead by that point, but we tried to save Gideon. Our efforts were, however,
    in vain.



    Subject Alpha is now back in its tank, sedated, and the development
    of Beta has been halted until we have decided what to do. As the senior scientist,
    I have taken the lead until further notice, and will most likely continue Gideon''s
    research logs regardless of whether or not I will keep the leadership position.



    I
    plan on keeping working on this project no matter what. The society needs the
    work force Project Moonshot can offer, and I plan on delivering.'

    Today, our new neurobiologist, Heinz Rippner,
    arrived at our facility. So far, everything has looked good and he has offered
    excellent insights on things Samantha ignored with subjects Alpha and Beta. We
    are currently considering terminating them and starting over; it appears that
    Alpha and Beta are both unsalvageable.



    This is probably the first time
    since Samantha and Gideon''s death that I have actually felt hopeful.'

    NOTLysandre: You got a minute, Oscar?

    Award:
    Always when there''s time to sit down and chat. What do you need?

    NOTLysandre:
    Erlene''s pushing her fanfics on my face again :/

    Award: God have mercy.
    What this time?

    NOTLysandre: Giovanni x Blue

    Award: o_o How big yikes?

    NOTLysandre:
    Not as big as usual but it''s making me uncomfortable (as always). Her obsession
    with these is...

    NOTLysandre: Concerning, I guess.

    Award: I''d say
    at least agitating, but sure.

    Award: I''ll ask Iora if she can talk to her
    about this after I''ve administered the mandatory reprimand.

    NOTLysandre:
    Thanks. :)

    Award: No problem. Glad to help (:'

  m_Description: 'To whoever is reading this,



    Since you are holding this pad,
    it means you have been chosen to test this experimental pad. In case you have
    forgotten, this pad scans the text on any surface, let it be paper, screen or
    even a reflection and adds it to its own database to be viewed anywhere anytime
    as long as the pad''s battery has not run out. So far, my tests have proved that
    it works, but I need more user testing to see if something needs to be adjusted
    or fixed.



    You can view this document at any time in the database, which
    you can access by pressing I.



    Thank you for enrolling in the test program.



    Yours
    truly,

    Bell Lach
